## Python iterators and generators

1. Create a generator that generates the squares of numbers up to some number `N`.

2. Write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and `n` in comma separated form where `n` is input from console.

3. Define a function with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 3 and 4, between a given range 0 and `n`.

4. Implement a generator called `squares` to yield the square of all numbers from (a) to (b). Test it with a "for" loop and print each of the yielded values.

5. Implement a generator that returns all numbers from (n) down to 0.
