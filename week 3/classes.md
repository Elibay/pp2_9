## Python Classes

1. Define a class which has at least two methods:
`getString`: to get a string from console input
`printString`: to print the string in upper case.

2. Define a class named `Shape` and its subclass `Square`. The `Square` class has an `init` function which takes a `length` as argument. Both classes have a `area` function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

3. Define a class named `Rectangle` which inherits from `Shape` class from task 2. Class instance can be constructed by a `length` and `width`. The `Rectangle` class has a method which can compute the `area`.

4. Write the definition of a Point class. Objects from this class should have a
    - a method `show` to display the coordinates of the point
    - a method `move` to change these coordinates
    - a method `dist` that computes the distance between 2 points

5. Create a bank account class that has attributes `owner`, `balance` and two methods `deposit` and `withdraw`. Withdrawals may not exceed the available balance. Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.
```python
class Account:
    pass
```

6. Write a program which can filter prime numbers in a list by using `filter` function.
Note: Use `lambda` to define anonymous functions.
