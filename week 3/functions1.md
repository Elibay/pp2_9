## Python Function

1. A recipe you are reading states how many grams you need for the ingredient. Unfortunately, your store only sells items in ounces. Create a function to convert grams to ounces. 
`ounces = 28.3495231 * grams`

2. Read in a Fahrenheit temperature. Calculate and display the equivalent centigrade temperature. The following formula is used for the conversion:
`C = (5 / 9) * (F – 32)`

3. Write a program to solve a classic puzzle: 
We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?
`create function: solve(numheads, numlegs):`

4. You are given list of numbers separated by spaces. Write a function `filter_prime` which will take list of numbers as an agrument and returns only prime numbers from the list.

5. Write a function that accepts string from user and print all permutations of that string.

6. Write a function that accepts string from user, return a sentence with the words reversed.
`We are ready -> ready are We`

7. Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 somewhere.
```python
def has_33(nums):
    pass

has_33([1, 3, 3]) → True
has_33([1, 3, 1, 3]) → False
has_33([3, 1, 3]) → False
```

8. Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains `007` in order
```python
def spy_game(nums):
    pass

spy_game([1,2,4,0,0,7,5]) --> True
spy_game([1,0,2,4,0,5,7]) --> True
spy_game([1,7,2,0,4,5,0]) --> False
```
9. Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.

10. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. Note: don't use collection `set`.

11. Write a Python function that checks whether a word or phrase is `palindrome` or not. Note: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam

12. Define a functino `histogram()` that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, `histogram([4, 9, 7])` should print the following:
```
****
*********
*******
```

13. Write a program able to play the `"Guess the number"` - game, where the number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. This is how it should work when run in a terminal:
``` 
Hello! What is your name?
KBTU

Well, KBTU, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
Take a guess.
12

Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
16

Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
19

Good job, KBTU! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!
```

14. Create a python file and import some of the functions from the above 13 tasks and try to use them.
